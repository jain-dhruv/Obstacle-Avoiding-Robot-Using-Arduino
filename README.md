# Obstacle-Avoiding-Robot-Using-Arduino

An obstacle avoiding bot built with:</br>
  **-1 Arduino UNO**</br>
  **-1 Ultrasonic Sensor module**</br></br>
Movement control using:</br>
  **-Motor Driver IC L293D (4 wheeled)**
  
  It's a simple robot that detects and avoid obstacle using arduino. Whenever it detects an obstacle at a certain distance using ultrasonic sensor it stops moving and   then move backwards. Turns left and starts moving in the forward direction to avoid it. The movements of the wheels are controlled by Motor Driver and the mircrocontoller is programmed using Arduino IDE.
